# Oscilloscope

FPGA + ESP32 firmware for an oscilloscope: the Tang Nano 20K buffers ADC samples; an ESP32 streams them to a laptop for display.

## Hardware

- Sipeed Tang Nano 20K (GW2AR-18C)
- ESP32 (laptop link)

## Repository layout

| Path | Role |
|------|------|
| `fpga/nano_tango/` | Tang Nano 20K RTL, constraints, Gowin build |
| `esp32/` | ESP-IDF firmware (streamer) |

## Build

**FPGA** (needs [Gowin EDA](https://www.gowinsemi.com/) `gw_sh` and [openFPGALoader](https://github.com/trabucayre/openFPGALoader)):

```bash
make -C fpga/nano_tango build
make -C fpga/nano_tango prog
```

**ESP32** (needs [ESP-IDF](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/)):

```bash
cd esp32
idf.py set-target esp32
idf.py build
idf.py flash monitor
```

## Branch protection (`main`)

Direct pushes and force pushes to `main` are not allowed. Work on a branch and open a pull request:

```bash
git checkout -b my-change
git push -u origin HEAD
# open a PR into main, then merge on GitHub
```

Enforcement is a GitHub **repository ruleset** (not Actions alone). The policy lives in [`.github/rulesets/main.json`](.github/rulesets/main.json).

### One-time ruleset setup

1. Create a fine-grained PAT with **Administration: Read and write** for this repository.
2. Add it as a repository secret named `RULESET_TOKEN`.
3. Run the **Apply main ruleset** workflow (`workflow_dispatch`), or apply locally:

```bash
export RULESET_TOKEN=...   # same PAT
export GITHUB_REPOSITORY=AveryLor/oscilloscope-dev
./.github/scripts/apply-main-ruleset.sh
```

Repository admins can bypass the ruleset for break-glass only. [`.github/workflows/guard-main.yml`](.github/workflows/guard-main.yml) also fails the Actions run if a forced push to `main` is ever observed.
